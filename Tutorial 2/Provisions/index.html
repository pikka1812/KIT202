                Run marathon for children living in poverty. Children living in poverty face barries to accessing an education. 
                Increasing access to education can improve the overall health and longevity of a society and growing economies. Yet in many developing countries,
                children's access to education can be limited by numerous factors. Therefore, we run to raise the fund for kids who need a support for their education.
